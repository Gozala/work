# Navigation Trails

Tabs, Browsing History, Bookmarks proved to be a poor tools with essentially a same task. User research lead us believe that we could upgrade existing metaphors and present those through a different lens that we called "navigation trails". Existing browsing sessions and browsing history got mapped onto expandable card stacks that also attempted to capture forks in navigation & blur lines between active sessions (tabs) and inactive ones (history) to better utilize visual space and computer resources.

Making snappy user interface in 3D space with infinitely large canvas at 60FPS using web platform was not the only challenge. Zooming in / out between web content and navigation trail meant web content had to remain alive for active trails, while older trails needed a way to be capturing such that they could be restored at will.
