# Frame free web



Web should be able to art-direct the experience. We explode ways to give the window back to the web and get rid off the ugly frame around it. To accomplish this we developed minimal chrome that like chameleon would adapt and blend in with the the content by picking up the same color scheme. To take it step further chrome would scroll out with the content and reappear if you reach for it.

The browser is actually on OS in disguise. It needs better task switching solution than tabs that force some users to a constant maintenance or cause them to give up and declare tab bankruptcy.  In this concept we explored using same metaphor as found in operating systems.

We have learned that OS task switching worked really well for small number of tabs and ordering them by access recency was great. However it did not work all that well with large number of tabs. We also explored grouping tabs by top level domain, similar to how MacOS groups windows by application.

Minimal, content blending chrome felt amazing and something that we kept in all the concepts that had followed with some minimal changes.
