# Web Cards

### Problem

There is no discovery component to the browser, only task-oriented search.

Itâ€™s too hard for publishers to syndicate content to mobile. Facebook is using their leverage to supplant the web with Instant Articles.



### Hypothesis

- Follow sites you visit.
- Timeline shows you new cards from sites.
- Webcards API lets sites push stories to you.
