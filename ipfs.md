# IPFS protocol support in Firefox

[I have collaborated with IPFS][ipfs-collaboration] team on integrating [libdweb][] into [IPFS Companion][] add-on. This made it possible to run a full fledged IPFS node in the Firefox extension context adding `ipfs://` protocol support to Firefox.

This work had being noticed by the [Brave browser][] and soon after they successfully collaboration with IPFS team and brought [libdweb][] inspired APIs to Brave extensions and subsequently IPFS protocol support. _(Image below shows  IPFS protocol support in brave)_.
