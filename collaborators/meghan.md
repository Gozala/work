I had the pleasure of working with Meghan Sinnott at [Protocol Labs][],  where she not only excelled in her role but also left a lasting  impression on those around her. Her passion and curiosity resulted in  more intentional messaging and design for our products, and her  meticulous approach to work and attention to detail made her a valuable  asset to our team. Beyond her impressive work ethic, Meghan is also a  warm and friendly person with a great sense of humor, a positive  attitude, and a collaborative approach to problem-solving. It was a  privilege to get to know her on a personal level and I am confident she  will continue to succeed and make a positive impact in any future  endeavors. I highly recommend Meghan for any opportunity and consider it a privilege to have had the opportunity to work with her.
