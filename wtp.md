# WebTorrent concept browser

[@tom-james-watson][] implemented a concept distributed web browser powered by torrents. Instead of the traditional client/server architecture, websites are published and loaded via torrents. [wtp-ext][] web extension uses [libdweb][] to add protocol `wtp://` protocol support to the Firefox. _(Image below shows wtp site being loaded in Firefox)_
